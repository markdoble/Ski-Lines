								<p>
								By selling products through this website, as a merchant, you agree to abide by the return policy set forth in these terms. As a purchaser, by buying products through this site, you agree to the return policy set forth in these terms.
								</p>
								<br />
								CONDITIONS FOR RETURNS<br /><br />
								<p>
									Merchant's agree to accept returns for products that have not been used or are as new, on the condition that the purchaser contacts the merchant and expresses their intent to return an item within 14 days of receiving the item. Merchant's also agree that a full refund for the item price and applicable taxes will be made to the purchaser upon merchant's receipt of the item, and all shipping fees are non-refundable, and at the expense of the purchaser.
								</p>
								<p>
									Purchaser's agree that returning a product to a merchant in exchange for a full refund is permitted only if: <br />
									1. the purchaser sufficnetly communicates their intent to return the item in question to the merchant within 14 days of receiving the product so that the merchant understand the purchaser's intent to return the item, and;<br />
									2. the product is in a condition that is as new or evidently not used, as determined by the merchant and their assessment of their ability to sell the item in the future as new. <br /><br />

									Upon receiving the returned item from the purchaser, and determining the product is in a condition sufficient to be returned, the condition as defined in this policy, the merchant authorizes Ski-Lines to refund the purchaser's payment amount, minus the shipping fees set out by the merchant at the time the purchaser purchased the item in question. <br />
								</p>
								<br />
								SHIPPING<br /><br />
								<p>
									Merchant's agree to use best efforts to prepare the product for pick-up, if the purchaser has opted to pick-up the purchased item in-store, or send the product for delivery, in a time that is reasonable. A non-reasonable time-frame for sending a product for delivery is any time outside of 3 business days from the time of purchase, as defined by the order time and date. <br />
								</p>
								<p>
									The merchant agrees that their account, which permits them to sell their products on Ski-Lines, will be in jeopardy if any of these terms, including shipping and return policies, are not strictly adhered to.
								</p>
								<br />

								<p>
									Merchants agree to the pricing terms listed herein, which are as follows. Ski-Lines.com's fee is 6.45% of the transaction total, excluding sales tax. We also charge 3.4% of the entire transaction, including sales tax, to cover payment processing and bank transfer fees.
